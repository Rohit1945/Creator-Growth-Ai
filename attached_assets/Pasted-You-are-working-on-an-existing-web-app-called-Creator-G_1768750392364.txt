You are working on an existing web app called Creator Growth AI built with Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
The UI and core AI logic already exist and are working well.
Your task is to FINALIZE the app completely with zero bugs.

CURRENT STATE (IMPORTANT – DO NOT BREAK)

UI is finalized and must NOT be redesigned or visually changed

Text input + YouTube link input works

YouTube Data API integration works using YOUTUBE_API_KEY

Video upload works up to transcription

Existing /api/analyze route produces correct AI output:

Titles

Description

Hashtags

Tags

Performance / reach prediction

Next video ideas

REQUIRED FIXES & COMPLETION TASKS
1. COMPLETE VIDEO UPLOAD FLOW (CRITICAL)

The /api/uploadVideo route must:

Accept .mp4 / .mov

Extract audio

Transcribe audio to text

Immediately send the transcript to the existing /api/analyze route

Return a single JSON response:

{
  "transcript": "...",
  "analysis": { full AI output }
}


Do NOT return transcript alone

Do NOT stop at “Transcribing…”

2. FRONTEND STATE FIX (NO STUCK STATES)

Frontend must clearly transition states:

"idle"

"transcribing"

"analyzing"

"done"

When "done":

Render results using existing Day-1 UI cards

Ensure no infinite loading, no undefined states

3. ERROR HANDLING (SILENT & CLEAN)

Handle:

Invalid YouTube links

Empty transcript

Unsupported file type

Missing API keys

Show clean user-friendly messages

App must never crash or white-screen

4. CODE QUALITY CONSTRAINTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Do NOT create massive 1000+ line files

Keep logic modular and readable

No unnecessary libraries

No database

No authentication

Keep everything compatible with Replit Free Tier

5. FINAL VERIFICATION

After completing changes, ensure:

Text input → works

YouTube link → works

Video upload → works end-to-end

All three paths produce identical AI output format

No console errors

No TypeScript errors

GOAL

Deliver a production-ready MVP that:

Analyzes creator content

Predicts reach & engagement

Suggests optimized metadata

Suggests future video ideas

This is the final completion pass.
Do not add new features.
Do not redesign UI.
Focus only on correctness, stability, and polish.
