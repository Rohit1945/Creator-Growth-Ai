Context:
This is a React + TypeScript + Vite project using Tailwind CSS.
The project already has routing (react-router-dom) and pages structure under src/pages.
I do NOT want to use any premium or paid Replit features, libraries, or templates.

TASKS TO DO (VERY IMPORTANT):

REMOVE premium dependency

Identify and remove any premium-gated components or services related to:

Authentication

User stats

History

Replace them with custom-built free alternatives

AUTHENTICATION (FREE)

Implement authentication using Firebase Authentication (free tier)

Features required:

Email + Password Sign Up

Email + Password Login

Logout

Create these pages:

src/pages/Login.tsx

src/pages/Signup.tsx

Store auth state globally using React Context

Protect private routes (redirect to /login if user not logged in)

USER DASHBOARD (NO PREMIUM)

Create a page: src/pages/Dashboard.tsx

Dashboard should show:

Logged-in user email

Account creation date

Total analyses performed

HISTORY FEATURE (FREE)

Store user analysis history using Firebase Firestore (free tier):

analyzed link / username

platform (YouTube / Instagram / Website)

date & time

Create page: src/pages/History.tsx

Fetch and display history only for the logged-in user

ANALYZE FEATURE (SOCIALBLADE-LIKE MVP)

Create page: src/pages/Analyze.tsx

Input:

Channel link OR username

Detect platform automatically:

YouTube

Instagram

Website

For now:

Save input to history

Show detected platform

Show placeholder analytics text (API integration later)

NAVBAR (FREE & SIMPLE)

Create reusable Navbar.tsx

Show links based on auth state:

Logged out: Home | Login | Signup

Logged in: Home | Analyze | Dashboard | History | Logout

ROUTING

Update App.tsx to include routes:

/

/login

/signup

/analyze (protected)

/dashboard (protected)

/history (protected)

NO PREMIUM / NO PAID UI

Do NOT use:

Replit premium auth

Paid UI kits

Subscription-based analytics

Use plain React, Firebase, Tailwind

GOAL:
Convert this project into a fully free, production-ready MVP that does NOT depend on any Replit premium services and supports authentication, user stats, history, and analysis pages.
